            <p> Organizing and hosting the Ready Set Market! (RSM) case competition in collaboration with the Innovative Business Association at UofT was a rewarding experience.</p>
            <p> Promoting the event to over 1500 students, professors, and industry professionals required determination, contributing to the success of the event attended by 150 people. On the event day, I enjoyed hosting & engaging with attendees, I remember making down the lunch queue to talk to everyone.</p>

    <h5>UPCOMING</h5>
    <h1>A Small, Big Project</h1>
    <p> I have always had trouble applying to internships consistently. Some days I will sit down for a few hours, but then weeks will pass without applying to a single one. </p>
    <p> My goal is to create a simple solution that reminds and encourages. Not a comprehensive, integrated solution –– a reminder. Unfortunately, this requires knowledge a bit beyond my reach of python and webdev. I will need to learn data analytics, electron API, & more.  </p>
    <p> Until then, I have made an alternative tracker (mostly for myself), that I use to keep track of internships. I find it really helpful. </p>

    <p> Although this iteration of my website took me less than 2 days to make, this was certainly not the case when initially learning how.</p>
